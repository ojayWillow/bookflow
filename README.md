# BookFlow

Multi-tenant SaaS booking platform. Each business gets their own public booking page at `/book/[slug]`. Customers book online, business owners manage everything from an admin panel, and both sides get email confirmations.

**Stack:** Next.js 14 · Supabase · Resend · Tailwind CSS · Vercel

## 🔧 Session fixes — 16 Mar 2026

Four bugs found and fixed in this session. All are deployed to `main`.

### 1. Business isolation leak in `/api/slots` — CRITICAL
**File:** `src/app/api/slots/route.ts`

The "Anyone available" staff query had **no `user_id` or `business_id` filter**. It fetched active staff from ALL businesses that shared a `service_id`, meaning one business's staff hours (e.g. `work_start = 03:00`) would bleed into every other business's booking page.

**Fix:** Fetch `user_id` from `business_settings` first, then scope both the specific-staff and anyone-staff queries with `.eq('user_id', biz.user_id)`.

### 2. Staff hours not clamped to business hours
**File:** `src/lib/slots.ts` → `getSlotsForDate()`

Staff `work_start` / `work_end` were used **raw** with no clamping. A staff member with `work_start = 03:00` would show 03:00 slots even if the business opens at 09:00.

**Fix:** Clamp in both `getSlotsForDate` and `getUnionSlotsForDate`:
```ts
effectiveOpen  = Math.max(staff.workStart, biz.open_time)
effectiveClose = Math.min(staff.workEnd,   biz.close_time)
```
Staff can **never** be bookable outside the business window, regardless of their personal hours.

### 3. Booking page statically cached — settings changes not instant
**File:** `src/app/book/[slug]/page.tsx`

The Server Component had no `dynamic` export, so Next.js/Vercel cached the page at build time. Changes to `open_time`, `close_time`, `open_days` in business settings had no effect until the next deployment.

**Fix:** Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` — every page load now fetches fresh from Supabase. Business settings changes are instant.

### 4. DayView time labels clipping
**File:** `src/app/admin/_components/DayView.tsx`

Time gutter labels were positioned at `absolute -top-2` (−8px above the row), which placed them outside the row's bounding box and got clipped by the `overflow-y-auto` scroll container.

**Fix:** Changed to `absolute top-1` (inside the row). Also added `padStart(2, '0')` so hours always render as `09:00` not `9:00`.

## 🌍 Internationalisation (i18n)

The app has **two separate translation systems** — one for the public booking pages, one for the admin panel. Do not mix them up.

### System 1 — Public booking pages

**Supported locales:** `lv` (default) · `en` · `ru`

**Files:**
```
src/i18n/
├── en.ts       ← English (PublicDict type is defined here)
├── lv.ts       ← Latvian
└── ru.ts       ← Russian
```

**How it works:** Server Components call `getDictionary(locale)` from `src/i18n/index.ts`. The locale comes from the URL segment (`/[locale]/...`). Each file is code-split and only loaded when needed.

**To update a public page translation:** Open the relevant locale file (e.g. `src/i18n/lv.ts`) and update the key. The `PublicDict` type in `en.ts` is the source of truth — TypeScript will error if a key is missing in `lv.ts` or `ru.ts`.

---

### System 2 — Admin panel

**Supported locales:** `lv` · `en` · `ru`

**How it works:** The admin panel uses a `useAdminLang()` hook (client-side, localStorage-based). The hook reads the saved locale from `localStorage` and returns a `t` object. Usage in any component:

```ts
const { t } = useAdminLang()
// then use t.staff.title, t.settings.save, etc.
```

**File structure — per-section (as of 16 Mar 2026):**
```
src/i18n/admin/
├── en.ts                        ← barrel file — assembles all sections into AdminDict
├── lv.ts                        ← barrel file — Latvian
├── ru.ts                        ← barrel file — Russian
└── sections/
    ├── nav/          en.ts · lv.ts · ru.ts
    ├── overview/     en.ts · lv.ts · ru.ts
    ├── bookings/     en.ts · lv.ts · ru.ts
    ├── services/     en.ts · lv.ts · ru.ts
    ├── staff/        en.ts · lv.ts · ru.ts
    ├── schedule/     en.ts · lv.ts · ru.ts
    ├── branding/     en.ts · lv.ts · ru.ts
    ├── share/        en.ts · lv.ts · ru.ts
    ├── settings/     en.ts · lv.ts · ru.ts
    └── common/       en.ts · lv.ts · ru.ts
```

**To update an admin translation:** Open only the section file you need, e.g.:
- Fixing a Staff page label → `src/i18n/admin/sections/staff/lv.ts`
- Fixing a Settings page label → `src/i18n/admin/sections/settings/lv.ts`
- Fixing a nav item → `src/i18n/admin/sections/nav/ru.ts`

**To add a new admin page:**
1. Create a new folder under `src/i18n/admin/sections/your-page/`
2. Add `en.ts`, `lv.ts`, `ru.ts` with your strings
3. Import and add to the barrel files `admin/en.ts`, `admin/lv.ts`, `admin/ru.ts`
4. The `AdminDict` type updates automatically — TypeScript will catch any missing keys in `lv` or `ru`

**Known issues / still to do:**
- [ ] Day name abbreviations in `ScheduleSection` (`Sun Mon Tue...`) are hardcoded in English — needs locale-aware day names
- [ ] `nav.share` in Latvian was `'Dalītājs'` (wrong — means "divider") — **fixed to `'Kopīgot'`** in the 16 Mar restructure
- [ ] Public booking pages (`src/i18n/lv.ts`, `ru.ts`) have not been audited for completeness since the Settings page was expanded — worth a pass before launch

## 🏗️ Architecture — business isolation rules

Every query **must** be scoped to a single business. Here's how each layer enforces isolation:

| Layer | Isolation method |
|---|---|
| Admin API routes (`/api/staff`, `/api/services`, `/api/settings`) | `user_id` from Supabase session cookie |
| Public slot API (`/api/slots`) | `user_id` resolved from `business_settings` via `businessId` param |
| Public queries (`getServicesForBusiness`, `getStaffForBusiness`) | `user_id` resolved from `business_settings` via `businessId` |
| Booking creation (`/api/book`) | `business_id` verified against DB before insert |
| Supabase RLS | Last line of defence — all tables have RLS policies |

**Key rule:** Staff hours are always clamped inside business hours. A staff member working `07:00–20:00` at a business open `09:00–18:00` will only show slots `09:00–18:00`. Business `open_time`/`close_time` is the hard outer boundary.

- [ ] Custom domain support (Pro plan)

### Nice to have
- [ ] White-label / Agency plan features
- [ ] API access for Agency plan
- [ ] Waitlist / invite-only mode before public launch
